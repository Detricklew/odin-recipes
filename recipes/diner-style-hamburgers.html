    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Diner Burgers are small disks, 4 ounces or less, as opposed to big thick Steakhouse Steakburgers. 
        I have named my version of the Diner Burger after J. Wellington Wimpy, a character in the Popeye cartoon series, who was addicted to burgers.
         This style of pressed burger has also become known as a smash burger.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>The Burger</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound finely ground chuck steak</li>
        <li>kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Mix-ins</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cooking The Burger</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon beef fat, bacon fat, or vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Buns</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Hamburger buns</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>4 slices american cheese</li>
        <li>4 thin slices of sweet onion</li>
        <li>4 leaves of crunchy lettuce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep.</strong> Place the meat in a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Mix in the mix-ins in a bowl using a fork or your hands. Pack the meat into a ball about 2-inches (51 mm) across.</li>
        <li><strong>Fire up.</strong> Preheat a cast iron griddle or heavy frying pan to about at least 350°F (167°C), as hot as you can get it.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook.</strong> Add 1 teaspoon of butter per bun to the griddle. It will foam quickly, so spread it out evenly over the surface, place the buns, cut-side down into the butter, press them down with the spatula and put a dinner plate on top of them so they make good contact with the surface, and cook until the bread turns golden.</li>
        <li>Melt some beef fat, bacon fat, or pour some vegetable oil on the griddle. You want just a thin coat. Do not use butter. It has too much water in it. When it begins to smoke, add the burger balls, and press down with a solid spatula so there is good contact between the meat and the surface and so the edges are jagged. A slotted spatula will not do the job. You need to smash the burger soon after the patty goes on, and not again until you flip.</li>
        <li>Now it will take you a couple of tries to know exactly when to flip, so at first you may have to peek. The bottoms should be dark brown. If they are, gently work a clean spatula under the burgers, pressing on the griddle to make sure you don't leave brown bits behind and that they don't break apart.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve.</strong> Once they are fully cooked, place each patty on a bun along with onion and lettuce</li>
    </ol>
